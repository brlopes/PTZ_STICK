Admonition
==========

Summary
-------

The Admonition extension adds [rST-style][rST] admonitions to Markdown documents.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library.

[rST]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#specific-admonitions

Syntax
------

Admonitions are created using the following syntax:

    !!! type "optional explicit title within double quotes"
        Any number of other indented markdown elements.

        This is the second paragraph.

`type` will be used as the CSS class name and as default title. It must be a
single word. So, for instance:

    !!! note
        You should note that the title will be automatically capitalized.

will render:

    <div class="admonition note">
    <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p>You should note that the title will be automatically capitalized.</p>
    </div>

Optionally, you can use custom titles. For instance:

    !!! danger "Don't try this at home"
        ...

will render:

    <div class="admonition danger">
    <p class="admonition-title">Don't try this at home</p>
    <p>...</p>
    </div>

If you don't want a title, use a blank string `""`:

    !!! important ""
        This is a admonition box without a title.

results in:

    <div class="admonition important">
    <p>This is a admonition box without a title.</p>
    </div>


rST suggests the following `types`, but you're free to use whatever you want:
    attention, caution, danger, error, hint, important, note, tip, warning.

Styling
-------

There is no CSS included as part of this extension. Look up the default
[Sphinx][sphinx] theme if you need inspiration.
