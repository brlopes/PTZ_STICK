Python-Markdown 2.2.1 Release Notes
===================================

Python-Markdown 2.2.1 is a bug-fix release. No new features have been added.
However, at least one bug fix does not work in Python 2.4 so that version of
Python is no longer supported. For a full list of changes, see the git log.
